# Data Engineering Zoomcamp Learning Notes

DataTalks hosted a series of webinar videos for a data engineering bootcamp (or in their term: zoomcamp), and I decided that I want to join it! In this repository, I tried to replicate the projects presented by the instructor. Disclaimer, I often times use the code from the official zoomcamp repository (https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp).

I partitioned the materials into lessons, and each lesson contained a project and a learning note (`notes.md`). This notes contains the information to reproduce the works and some general insights that I got from the project.

This repository is not designed for public use, hence the learning notes are not well-structured and kinda random. I only put notes on the thing that feels new to me. So, please refer to the official repository for more detailed notes. Enjoy! :D
